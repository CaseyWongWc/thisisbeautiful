 can make a new jpanel to the right of trade offers for a demo trade? ( Trader
What is this Trader? A Trader is a person in that square. The player can suggest a trade. For
example, the player can say "I'll give you 2 food and 1 gold for 3 water". The trader can then counter with another trade, or the trader can accept. ) here was the deifninition from my assignment. can we have a demo trade offer with two panels stacked above and below each other? the first panel imitates a player's current values,so we can have spinners for current gold, current water and current hunger. one a trade is conducted, the item name, image and integer values will display for the traade,and the traders respective dialogue. the trader offer should contain an integer price celinged and between the min and maxes of the trade offer during the trader demo, we can click three buttons when accepting a trade presented:accept trade,deny trade, steal and leave. accept trade button: adds the item's properties to each of the three respected stats, the item displayed will change to another item in the traders list, and the trade cycle loops. deny trade: in which the player will be taken to a recieve trade scene. in the receive trade scene, players will be taken to another sub-scene with three int sliders for hunger,thirst and gold to trade. the trade offer will determine the object offered back to the player based on how closely any of the three values match an object in their list, if no values are in the (not yet made, min and max trade recieve percentage) threshhold, the trader will decline and offer players a random object from their inventory for a random price. when a back and fourth exchange has been completed between the palyer and the trader, current trades offered would iterate upwards. if the trader accepts the players stats, the repective value will deduct from the player and the items stats will be added to the player. a player can leave at any time, or steal.
