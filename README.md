## Communication Guidelines

- When requesting changes, be specific about which feature or component you want to modify
- Before implementing major changes, confirm with the user first
- If encountering issues or errors, document them clearly in the "Known Issues" section
- Reference specific files when discussing code changes
- Focus on one feature/change at a time to avoid introducing multiple issues

## Project Context 

- This project is based on a previous Java implementation that was more complex
- Future goals include implementing spawners for items and NPCs
- The project is sensitive to changes - avoid making untested modifications
- When in doubt about implementation details, ask for clarification rather than making assumptions
- Reference the original Java version when appropriate for understanding complex mechanics
